## Project Title 
---
The project will be called The Health App. The Health App was created for fitness enthusiasts and the general population. 

## The Health App Features
---

To start the app, the user enters "python3 main.py" into the terminal. The app will start and the user will be presented with a welcome message and four options. These four options are:
1. BMI
2. Weight Converter 
3. Calories Needed
4. Stopwatch 

The user will have to enter "1", "2", "3" or "4" depending on what option the user is interested in. If the numbers 1,2,3 or 4 are NOT entered, the question will be repeated until one of the four numbers are entered. 

### #1 - BMI
---

When #1 - BMI is selected, a message will appear informing the user that they have selected the Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator. The user will need to input their height in metres (for example 178cm = 1.78m) and also input their weight in kilograms (kg). If weight in kilograms is unknown, please see The Weight Converter feature. Once the weight and height has been entered, the calculator will present the BMI. Depending on the BMI results, the calculator will also present whether based on the results, the user is Underweight, in the Healthy range, Overweight or Obese. On completion, the app will close. 

## #2 - Weight Converter 
---
By selecting "2" as an option on the main.py page, the user is taken to the "Weight Converter" section. Here the user is given 2 options on what they would like to convert: 
1. Pounds to Kilograms
2. Kilograms to Pounds

Selecting "1" will convert the users pounds to kilograms and selecting "2" will convert kilograms to pounds. This will be useful if the user doesn't know their weight in kilograms for the BMI calculator. Once their weight is entered, their weight will be converted and presented and the app will close. 

## #3 - Calories Needed
---

Depending on the users needs, they might want to either Lose, Maintain or Gain weight. The Calories needed section assists with that. To locate to the Calories Needed section the user will need to select "3" on the main.py page. The user will then be requested to enter their weight in pounds. Once entered, the user will then be asked "what is your goal?" and presented with 3 options:
1. Maintain current weight 
2. Lose weight 
3. Gain weight 

Judging by what the user input whether its "1" to Maintain current weight, "2" to Lose weight or "3" to Gain weight, the weight calculator will present the required calories needed for their goals. The app will then close. 

## #4 - Stopwatch
---

The last feature presented on the Health App is the Stopwatch. This can be accessed by entering the option "4" on the main.py page. Once "4" is entered, the user will be prompted "To start the stopwatch, please press 'Enter/Return':". The stopwatch will not start unless the Enter button is pressed. The stopwatch will start and will not stop until the Enter button is pressed again. The time will then be presented as:
"Time spent: 0h: 0m: 0s"
This feature is great so that the user can time how long it takes to perform an exercise, such as running a certain distance. At completion, the app will close.
